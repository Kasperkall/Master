# Master thesis: Elimination of Reflections in Laser Scanning Using Transfer Learning from Simulation-Based Data to Real-World Data

This thesis study the use of transfer learning from a simulated dataset to a real-world dataset to remove laser-reflection. The models are tweaked with different combination of hyperparameters such as batch size, optimizers, learning rate and loss functions. The configurations are easily changed in the config.yaml file in the "config" folder. The simulated dataset (containing images and ground truths of the welds) was generated by Ola Alstad during his master thesis. In short, he used Blender, a 3D computer graphics program, and a ray tracing engine named LuxCoreRender to produce images of the welds. To use these images specific dataloaders were also made for this project. The real-world dataset was made during this thesis. The slurm-file setupIdun.slurm was used to run on the Idun cluster the first time. This includes some necessary packages. The slurm-file runImprove.slurm does can be run after all necessary packages have been installed and will run the improveTrain.py.
